This is an [R Markdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com) Notebook. When you execute code within the notebook, the results appear beneath the code. 

Try executing this chunk by clicking the *Run* button within the chunk or by placing your cursor inside it and pressing *Ctrl+Shift+Enter*. 

```{r}
library(dygraphs)
library(Quandl)
library(sqldf) #run sql statements in R
library(dplyr)
```

Add a new chunk by clicking the *Insert Chunk* button on the toolbar or by pressing *Ctrl+Alt+I*.
```{r}
df <- Quandl("FED/SVENY", api_key="15cxBvvbCzucYDswsDfJ")
covid_dates <- subset(df, Date > '2020-01-01' & Date < '2020-07-16')
```

When you save the notebook, an HTML file containing the code and output will be saved alongside it (click the *Preview* button or press *Ctrl+Shift+K* to preview the HTML file).
```{r}
df <- as.xts(x = df[, -1], order.by = df$Date)
covid_dates <- as.xts(x = covid_dates[, -1], order.by = covid_dates$Date)
dygraph(covid_dates, main = "Zero Coupon Yields (1-30) 2020", ylab = "percent") %>%
          dyLegend(width = 0) %>%
          dyRangeSelector()
  
```

The preview shows you a rendered HTML copy of the contents of the editor. Consequently, unlike *Knit*, *Preview* does not run any R code chunks. Instead, the output of the chunk when it was last run in the editor is displayed.
